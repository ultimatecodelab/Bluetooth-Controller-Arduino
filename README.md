# Bluetooth-Controller-Arduino
###Arjun Kharel and John Walsh (Software Development)

###Purpose of the application 
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate and implement the various gesture controls. We have created a Robot using Arduino and controlled it using armband. We have also developed an android app that allows user to control the movement of the robot via Bluetooth with the help of buttons presented in an app. The app also integrates the speech recognition feature, which means, you could directly talk to your app and  robot will react appropriately to your voice commands. 

###Mobile App
Developed an android app to control the robot remotely using the app user interface. 
Speech recognition – can directly talk to the app and it will forward the command to the Bluetooth chip. 
nRF UART can be used to connect to Bluetooth® Smart (Bluetooth low energy).When connected, the app can send and receive ASCII text strings.
